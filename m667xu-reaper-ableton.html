What is the best way to store ideas for later use in reaper?

They both offer great performance, features, and the product pricing Данная программа отлично подойдет пользователям, желающим создать музыку с нуля, редактировать трек, добавить эффектов или сделать ремикс.

Выбирая программу для редактирования аудиофайлов, каждый пользователь уже знает о том, что конкретно он хочет делать с тем или иным треком, следовательно, примерно понимает, какие. A bit of background: I've used Reaper for many years but have begun using Ableton because of it's superior MIDI implementation and syncing possibilities. My problem: I've recorded live drums in Ableton along to a couple of sequenced synth tracks, but because I'm more proficient in Reaper it's much easier for me to edit my tracks there. After doing so, and trying to move my .wavs back in to Ableton, they are completely out of sync with each other, with differing amounts of silence Ableton is a great program but is much more geared for working with MIDI tracks and producing electronic music. I have put many many hours into Ableton and Reaper. Trust me, if you are mainly tracking live instruments like guitars, then you should really at least try using Reaper for a few projects.

Hi all, Have come across the option for selecting extension in after recently downloading Reaper, Ableton gives the option to select reaper as an ext in, aswell as all channels or outputs for reaper. Anyone has any experience with this? Im looking at using reaper for its VST3 compatibility which ableton lacks and just running it through ableton as a bootleg plugin i guess. Thanks. I can't speak of Reaper, but what I really like about Ableton Live is how the whole concept of the studio being an instrument was realized, particularly since the announcement Русификатор для FL Studio 12; На этот раз проделан достаточно обширный, глубокий и вдумчивый перевод. 
There are over 50 digital audio workstations out there for you to choose from (well, Wikipedia lists 49 ( but I'll assume there are a few more). How do you choose which one is right for you? Here are some methods I'd suggest: Go with Acid Music Studio because you saw it at Best Buy on sale for only like .99 Go with FL Studio because you want to be a producer Go with Pro Tools because it's just what you do Go with Logic because.

I already have an Akai MPK Mini but I'm trying to pick the right DAW. I've narrowed it down to Reaper, Ableton, Studio One, and Logic. Just because I'm starting out, I don't want to spend an insane amount of money. I'm most likely looking at the cheapest versions of the DAWs listed above. My questions are: Which one is best for me to work with from the start? I want to begin fresh with one and learn it from the ground Some applications like Ableton Live and Reason are extremely complimentary to applications like Pro Tools, Logic Pro, and Reaper. In fact, Reason, and Ableton are designed to be just as cool working as an accessory to recording applications, as they are when being used as standalone applications.

A couple of really helpful workflow things in Logic I am dying to make key commands out of namely "Create Empty Midi Region" and a command for the Global solo/unsolo button at the top left of the arrange window. amp#x200B; I love using Logic as my main DAW but things like this (and no sample audition looping in File Browser (seriously wtf is that about)) make it difficult to stay true and not chip to Reaper/Ableton and the like. amp#x200B; Does anyone know a way around. Reaper sounds noticeably better than Ableton, to me. Though I find Live to be way easier to use, so I'm not that happy about this. I have been using Live only this year. I decided to break out Reaper tonight. In no time I had something that sounded richer than anything I've been able to pull together in Ableton recently.

I'm new to LMMS, (love it so far) I've worked with Reaper, Ableton, FL, OBS, Vegas Pro, etc so I can understand interfaces pretty well I guess. So I get my soundfonts, and drag them into the program. Whenever I move around on the Piano Roll, the higher on the keys I go, the faster the tempo gets? This is driving me insane, I would LOVE if any of you have any good tutorials, or walkthru websites/videos. I've never seen this sort of problem before lol. Thanks in advance.

So I'm trying to find a good DAW to use for recording/mixing/mastering. Some DAWS i'm considering: fl studio, reaper, ableton, garageband, logic pro X. Bit of background info: - I have both a mac and pc, ergo compatibility doesn't matter. (Although i'm up for suggestions if I should use my mac air or my pc). - Majority of these daws are fucking crazy expensive in AUD (0-400). - Beat production doesn't really matter (sometimes i fiddle around with making some beats, however, that's I think I finally decided to buy a new laptop after a long time waiting for the right laptop with good balance between power and overall design. I don't think that time really has come but I can't wait any longer. A lot of computers right now seems to have issues with throttling, at least if you want a sleeker computer = which usually has an option with better screeen which I kind of need (even though I dont actually want touch). I gonna use it with for my architecture studies: Autocad, Revit Switching from a crusty MacBookpro. First PC in about 15 years, so I’m looking to the masses for some insight/suggestions.

Thanks all. https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Bitetoeat/saved/qXQbXL. Hey All! I was ready to start looking at Pro Tools (for PC), and someone suggested that there were other cheaper and better alternatives. He suggested, Reaper, Ableton, FL Studio and Cubase. Having never heard of any of them before (and not wanting to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars), I was hoping that some of you more seasoned folks could help me choose my software. If it matters, I play guitar and would be recording standard rock n roll and blues music.

Total budget and country of purchase: Around 00 CAD (before tax on the item) in Canada Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. I'm looking for a 2-in-1 laptop to use for note taking in class in uni, compiling for computer science, music production and video production. Battery life is definitely a plus but because of the nature of my needs it's reasonable that it can't be a priority. So I bought an Akai MPK249 midi controller, loving it with Reaper and playing around with various VSTi's. Would like to use it live though but NOT have to run it through my laptop. Total noob question but are there any external synths out there that are essentially a processor for midi keyboards? I guess a physical version of say a FM synth VST?

Over the last two years I collected quite a few tracks and I feel like creating my own sets, eventually creating my own music and playing it some day. What software would you recommend for that with the knowledge that the genre is techno? Reaper, Ableton, FL? My device is a macbook air from 2010, will I actually be able to run programs like that smoothly. I thought it'd be cool if we could have a list of some of the terms that get used here and other guitar forums so everybody is on the same page, I'll start it out and everybody can jump in with more and I'll add them to the list to your credit.
